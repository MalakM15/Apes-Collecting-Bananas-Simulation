# Apes-Collecting-Bananas-Simulation
Multi-process, multi-threaded simulation using POSIX threads and shared memory IPC. Demonstrates concurrent programming with semaphore synchronization, deadlock prevention, and inter-process communication. Each family runs as a separate process with female, male, and baby threads competing in a maze.
