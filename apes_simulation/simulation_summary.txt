APES SIMULATION - FINAL RESULTS
================================

HOW THE SIMULATION WORKS:
-------------------------
- Each family has: 1 Male, 1 Female, 2 Babies
- Female enters maze from bottom row (row 19), collects bananas, exits at row 0
- Female deposits collected bananas into family basket when exiting
- Males can fight neighboring males - winner takes loser's basket!
- Females can fight if they meet in same cell - winner takes loser's carried bananas
- During male fights, babies can steal from OTHER families' baskets
- Babies either eat stolen bananas (removed from game) or give to their dad's basket
- Male withdraws family if energy drops below 15

Duration: 30.0 seconds
Termination: Timeout (30 seconds max)

PER-FAMILY STATISTICS (with explanations):
================================================================================

Family 0 (Active):
  COLLECTED (ways family gained bananas):
    From maze:          1  <- Female picked up from maze cells
    From male fights:   2  <- Male won fights, took opponent's basket
    From fem. fights:   0  <- Female won fights, took opponent's carried bananas
  LOST (ways family lost bananas):
    In male fights:     1  <- Male lost fights, opponent took our basket
    In fem. fights:     0  <- Female lost fights, opponent took our carried bananas
  FINAL STATUS:
    In basket:          0  <- Bananas saved in family basket
    Eaten by babies:    6  <- Bananas consumed by babies (removed from game)
      Baby 0 ate:  2
      Baby 1 ate:  4

================================================================================
TOTALS:
================================================================================
Initial bananas in maze:    100
Remaining in maze:           69  <- Still uncollected
Total collected by females:   8  <- Sum of all females' collections from maze
Total in all baskets:         1  <- Sum of all family baskets
Total eaten by all babies:    7  <- Removed from circulation

BALANCE CHECK:
  Initial (100) should = Remaining (69) + In baskets (1) + Eaten (7) = 77
  Note: Difference of 23 may be due to bananas in transit (carried by females)

================================================================================
WINNER: Family 2 with 1 bananas in basket!
